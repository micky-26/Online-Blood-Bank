# Online-Blood-Bank

An online application that handles all the details about blood donors, availability of various blood groups in each blood bank, and help them operate in a better way. We would use HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript, PHP, and MySQL for this purpose. Some of the features are:

1) Donor registration.
2) Inventory management for blood bank storage.
3) Donors who are suitable for donation with their contact information.
4) Transfering blood from one blood bank to another.
